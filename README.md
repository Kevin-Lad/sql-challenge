# sql-challenge
Description:
This is the homework challenge for week 9 of bootcamp, which focuses on SQL.

In the first part of the assignment, I am tasked with creating a table schema for six CSV files and then importing data into these tables. Proper use of primary and foreign keys was the main hurdle in this section.

The second part of the challenge is analyzing the data. There are various SELECT statements as well JOIN statements. The final select statement made use of the GROUP BY and ORDER BY functions.

The final part of the challenge is data modeling, which is an ERD of the tables.
